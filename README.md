# Notion Paste Links for Obsidian

This plugin brings Notion-style link pasting to Obsidian.

## Features

- **Paste Interception**: When you paste a URL, it is inserted immediately, and a menu appears allowing you to transform it.
- **Transformation Options**:
    - **Mention**: Converts the URL to `@[URL]` which renders as a styled pill with favicon and page title.
    - **Keep as URL**: Leaves the raw URL as is.
- **Context Menu**: Right-click on any existing URL or mention to convert between formats.
